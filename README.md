SBT OSGi Manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/digimead/sbt-osgi-manager.png)](https://travis-ci.org/digimead/sbt-osgi-manager)
================

OSGi development bridge based on Bnd and Tycho.

There is a [sample project][sp]. Please, overview `test` file which contains interactive example in [Scripted format][sc].

What is it? [SBT][sbt] Plugin for solid integration OSGi infrastructure with your favorite IDE.

Plugin provides such abilities as:

* resolving OSGi dependencies and dependencies with source code at Eclipse P2 update site
* resolving OSGi dependencies via OSGi R5 repositories
* generating bundle manifest

Resolved bundles are added to project to 'library-dependencies' settings key. Resolved bundles and their source code (if any) may be fetched with [sbt-dependency-manager][dm] or may be processed with your favorite tool that uses SBT dependency information (for example, SBT command `deliver-local`).
